# Summary
Sample and data management are one of the most important aspects for modern science.
Modern biological sciences rely on organizing samples into grids and tracking each individual sample.
Collecting and organizing these samples is especially important for processes like high throughput genotyping where thousands of samples are collected and must be individually tracked throughout the genotyping process.
Coordinate, an open-source Android application, helps with grid-based data collection by creating a visual grid layout and allows users to assign samples to specific cells in the grid.
Collected data can be exported and used as inputs for down-stream analyses.
Coordinate is highly customizable, allowing templates to be specifically defined for different end uses.
