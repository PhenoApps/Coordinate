Coordinate
==========

Introduction
------------
Coordinate is a flexible, open-source Android app that is used to collecting and organizing samples or data. Coordinate functions by defining templates and then collecting data in grids created from those templates.

Layout
------
Coordinate utilizes a bottom navigation toolbar that allows you to quickly switch between :doc:`grids`, :doc:`templates`,  :doc:`projects`, and :doc:`settings`. The top toolbar is reserved for actions relevant to each section of the app.
