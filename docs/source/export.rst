Exporting Data
==============

Once you are finished collecting data, grids can be exported by selecting the ‘Export’ option from either the grid list item or, if they are a part of a project, the project list item.

A default filename containing the grid name and current date is prefilled but can be edited prior to export. Exported grids are saved in a CSV format that is located in the “Exports” directory.
