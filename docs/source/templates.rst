Templates
=========

Templates allow defined structure and metadata across different grids that might be collected. Two templates are included by default, a 6x20 Seed Tray Template and a 8x12 DNA Plate template.


New Templates
-------------
Templates can be created by importing a template file or selecting the New Template icon from the top toolbar.


.. figure:: /_static/images/template_list_framed.png
   :figwidth: 35%
   :align: right
   :alt: Template list layout

List Layout
-----------
Each template in the list contains the template name, size, and date created on the left.

Action buttons on the right of each template list item allow non-default templates to be deleted (|delete|), edited, exported (|save|), grids created from that template to be viewed, or new grids to be created from that template.


Editing templates
-----------------
Templates can only be edited if no grids have been created using that template.


Deleting Templates
------------------
Deleting a template will delete all of the grids created using that template.
