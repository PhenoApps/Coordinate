Grids
=====
Grids are the basic unit through which data is collected within Coordinate. Each grid inherits its structure from its parent template. Grids can exist by themselves or as a group within a project.


New Grids
---------
Grids can be created by selecting the New Grid icon from the top toolbar, a template list item, or a project list item.


List Layout
-----------
Each grid in the list contains the grid name or identifier, parent template, and date created on the left.

Action buttons on the right of each list item allow a grid to be deleted, exported, or data to be collected.


Deleting Grids
--------------
Deleting a grid will delete all of the data that was collected within that grid.
