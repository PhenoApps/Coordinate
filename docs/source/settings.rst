Settings
========

Collection
----------

Direction
~~~~~~~~~
By default, Coordinate moves down each column when :doc:`collect`. This setting allows users to move across rows (left to right).

Notification sounds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enabling this setting adds a sound both when finishing a column and once the last cell in the grid has been filled.

Unique values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This setting allows the user to disallow duplicated values on a per grid basis, per project basis, or entirely within the app.

Layout
------

Scaling
~~~~~~~
The user can use this setting adjust how large the grid UI is in the Collect Data screen.

Export
------

Project export
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:doc:`projects` can be exported with each grid being a single file (all contained within in a zipped file) or all grids appended to a single CSV file.

Share exports
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This setting will utilize the Android share system, allowing the exported file to be sent using different apps already installed on the device.

Storage
-------

Define storage location
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This setting allows for the modification of the default Storage Location.

Database
~~~~~~~~
The internal database can be exported, imported, or deleted. Deleting the database will entirely erase all data that was collected and any other customizations that have been made within Coordinate.
