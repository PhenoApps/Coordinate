Projects
========

Groups of grids can be organized into a single project, simplifying data collection for larger experiments. Projects can be exported as a single file or multiple files, adjustable in the :doc:`/settings`. Grids can be added to Projects when they're created or from the :doc:`/collect` screen.

Each project in the list contains the project name, number of grids, and date created on the left.

Action buttons on the right of each list item allow a project to be deleted (|delete|), exported (|save|), grids in the project to be viewed (|grid-list|), or new grids to be created from that project (|grid-add|).


New Projects
------------
New projects can be created by clicking the New Project icon (|project-new|) on the top toolbar. New projects only require a name to be created.


Deleting Projects
-----------------
Deleting a project will delete all of the grids within that project.
