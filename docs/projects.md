Groups of grids can be organized into a single project, simplifying data collection for larger experiments. Projects can be exported as a single file or multiple files, adjustable in the [Settings](settings.md).
Grids can be added to Projects when they\'re created or from the [Collecting Data](collect.md) screen.

## List Item Layout

Each project in the list contains the project name, number of grids, and date created on the left.

Action buttons on the right of each list item allow a project to be deleted (<img class="icon" src="_static/icons/delete.png">), exported (<img class="icon" src="_static/icons/save.png">), grids in the project to be viewed (<img class="icon" src="_static/icons/grid-list.png">), or new grids to be created from that project (<img class="icon" src="_static/icons/grid-add.png">).

## New Projects

New projects can be created by clicking the New Project icon (<img class="icon" src="_static/icons/project-new.png">) on the top toolbar.
New projects only require a name to be created.

## Deleting Projects

Deleting a project will delete all of the grids within that project.
