# Coordinate

## Background

Statistical power increases with the number of samples being used for analysis, but managing samples at scale requires optimized tools and worfklows to minimize mistakes.
Organizational errors impede scientific progress and can lead to erroneous results or publication retractions.

Many life science research activities organize samples into grids and require metadata to be collected for downstream analyses.
`Coordinate` enables robust and customizable grid-based data collection by creating a mobile, virtual grid layout that can be populated as samples are collected.
In contrast to unstructured approaches, `Coordinate` provides standardized data workflows that reduce mistakes and allow for more efficient sample collection.

## Download

Coordinate can be downloaded from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wheatgenetics.coordinate).

Coordinate utilizes a bottom navigation toolbar that allows you to quickly switch between [Grids](grids.md), [Templates](templates.md), [Projects](projects.md), and [Settings](settings.md).
The top toolbar is used for actions relevant to each section of the app.
