Exporting data
==============

Once you are finished collecting data, grids can be exported by
selecting the 'Export' (<img ref="save" style="vertical-align: middle;" src="_static/icons/save.png" width="20px">)
option from either the grid list item or, if they are a part of a
project, the project list item.

A default filename containing the grid name and current date is
prefilled and can be edited prior to export. Exported grids are saved in
CSV format and are located in the "exports" directory.
