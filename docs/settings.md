# Settings

## Collection

#### Direction (<img class="icon" src="_static/icons/direction.png">)

By default, Coordinate moves down each column when [Collecting Data](collect.md).
This setting allows users to move across rows (left to right).

#### Notification sounds (<img class="icon" src="_static/icons/sounds.png">)

Enabling this setting adds a sound both when finishing a column and once the last cell in the grid has been filled.

#### Unique values (<img class="icon" src="_static/icons/unique.png"> and <img class="icon" src="/_static/icons/unique-options.png">)

This setting allows the user to disallow duplicated values on a per grid basis, per project basis, or entirely within the app.

## Layout

#### Scaling (<img class="icon" src="/_static/icons/resize.png">)

The user can use this setting adjust how large the grid UI is in the Collect Data screen.

## Export

#### Project export (<img class="icon" src="/_static/icons/export.png">)

[Projects](projects.md) can be exported with each grid being a single file (all contained within in a zipped file) or all grids appended to a single CSV file.

#### Share exports (<img class="icon" src="/_static/icons/share.png">)

This setting will utilize the Android share system, allowing the exported file to be sent using different apps already installed on the device.

## Storage

#### Define storage location (<img class="icon" src="/_static/icons/storage-location.png">)

This setting allows for the modification of the default Storage Location.

#### Database (<img class="icon" src="/_static/icons/database.png">)

The internal database can be exported, imported, or deleted.
Deleting the database will entirely erase all data that was collected and any other customizations that have been made within Coordinate.
